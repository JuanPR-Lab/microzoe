# 🧬 Microzoe Manifesto

### Towards a Symbiotic Existence

Microzoe is not just software; it is a tribute to life itself. We are inspired by Lynn Margulis's vision of the **Symbiotic Planet**, understanding that life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking.

In a world that often pushes us towards isolation and competition, we reclaim fermentation as an act of resistance and connection. We believe in a world where all beings—from the most microscopic bacterium to the human cultivating it—are sharing, communicating, and living together in harmony.

## 1. Your Laboratorium: Tending the Holobiont
You are not a solitary individual; you are an ecosystem, a holobiont. Your digital **Laboratorium** is the reflection of that internal ecosystem.

* **Local Sovereignty:** Just as a cell maintains its integrity while cooperating with the whole, Microzoe adopts the **"Local-First"** model. Your data, your recipes, and your processes live with you, on your device.
* **Autonomy:** We protect privacy not out of secrecy, but out of respect for biological and digital autonomy. There is no corporate "cloud" extracting value from your work; only you and your cultures in direct dialogue.

## 2. Nostr: The Digital Mycelium
Nature has no central servers. Bacteria exchange genes horizontally; fungi connect the forest through decentralized underground networks.

* **Organic Connection:** Microzoe is built upon **Nostr**, a protocol that mimics these natural networks. Without central authorities, it allows information to flow freely peer-to-peer.
* **Sovereign Identity:** Your public key (`npub`) is your unique footprint in this network, your chemical signal in the vast ocean of communication, uncensorable and persistent.

## 3. ZoeRelay: Horizontal Culture Transfer
Evolution advances when we share. Margulis taught us that life's great innovation (the eukaryotic cell) was born from the merger of different beings.

* **Co-Evolution:** **ZoeRelay** is the space for that merger. We don't just exchange messages; we exchange life. By sharing kefir grains, vinegar mothers, or koji spores, we are practicing a form of "horizontal transfer" of culture and biology.
* **Symbiotic Community:** We aspire to a network where knowledge and cultures circulate freely, enriching local and global biodiversity.

## 4. Open Source: The DNA of Knowledge
In nature, genetic information is the heritage of life. No one patents photosynthesis.

* **Free Software (FOSS):** Microzoe is open source because we believe knowledge, like seeds and bacteria, must be free. Anyone can audit, improve, and adapt ("mutate") it so it evolves with the community.

## 5. Conscious Responsibility
Cultivating life requires attention and care.

* **Data Custody:** As a sovereign system, you are the guardian of your information. If you delete your local data without a backup, it is lost, like a species going extinct.
* **Security:** Protect your keys (`nsec`) and make backups ("spores") of your work. Radical freedom entails radical responsibility.
